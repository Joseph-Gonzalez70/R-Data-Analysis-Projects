Guidelines:

You should find datasets at first and conduct proper data analysis. 
Your results should be written in report form, including a cover page and an appendix of your R code at the end of the report.

Dataset 3: Conduct PCA.

For each data analysis, you should write in full sentences, and have the
following sections for the body of your report.

Summary: Summarize your data by plots or sample estimates; 
Analysis: Implement the analysis based on what you have done in homework;
